# Movies-MVP-Architecture

Android architecture with MVP architecture. At the moment I'm using Retrofit2, RxJava2, Glide, Gson and ButterKnife as my Third-Party librarys.

Basically I'm trying to re-create the same app I've created using MVC architecture but now with MVP and better a better approach to the Third-Party librarys I was using.

In progression, I will keep this uptaded...
